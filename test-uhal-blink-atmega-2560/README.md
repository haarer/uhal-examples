[UHAL](https://github.com/haarer/uhal) is a c++ hardware abstraction layer. It is designed to generate minimum overhead.

This example blinks the LED on an Arduino Mega. The LED is connected to PB7. This example does not use a Board abstraction.

See the test-uhal-blink-arduino-mega example for board abstraction usage.

This is a platformio project. I recommend using vscode with the platformio extension.
